Error: <ipython-input-13-ec0a5a7876ae>:10: RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in double_scalars
         sequence[i + 2] = sequence[i + 1] * 2 + sequence[i] * 3

Problem: The problem I am recieving shows me that the equation is not able to compute as a double because the numbers are
         too large. To resolve this, I would need to use a BigInteger like I have in my original java code. The error also
         shows there is an issue with my files.
